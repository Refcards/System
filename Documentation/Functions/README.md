Signature, purpose and stub.
Write the function signature, a one-line purpose statement and a function stub.
A signature has the type of each argument, separated by spaces, followed byÂ ->, followed by the type of result. So a function that consumes an image and produces a number would have the signatureÂ Image -> Number.
